Running this notebook \"as is\" requires a Google account and access to the current Google Drive folder. \n","\n","The notebook expects the current folder to be located in the root of your Google Drive folder.  This can be accomplished without changing the folder location by creating a shortcut. Create a shortcut to the current \"PFAS Lab Report Extractor\" folder and save the shortcut to your Google Drive root folder, as described below:  \n","\n","1.   In the Google Drive directory, right click on the current folder \"*PFAS Lab Report Extraction Tool/*\" and select \"***Add Shortcut to Drive***\". \n","2.   When asked to select where to add the shortcut, highlight \"*My Drive*\" (without selecting the arrow to open the Drive folder), and click \"*Add Shortcut*\". \n","3.   A shortcut will now be created in your root Google Drive folder.  \n","  \n","https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop  \n","\n","As long as there is a shortcut to the \"PFAS Lab Report Extractor\" folder in your Google Drive root folder, the folder that it points to be located anywhere in a Google Drive structure (i.e., it may be copied from its original location in the \"GQP Fall 2021/\" shared folder to a new location for MassDEP use). Alternatively, the shortcut may be saved a different location if desired, with minor updates to the code to reflect the change.  \n"," \n","**Mounting and Autorizing Google Drive Access**  \n","The notebook will attempt to mount the Google Drive folder, and request access (either via \"click\" to authorize, or by copying and pasting an authorization string in the notebook cell where indicated. *Authorization must be granted to enable this workbook to run in Google Colab and access the PDF Lab reports on Google Drive.*\n","\n","The notebook will attempt to mount the Google Drive folder, and request access (either via \"click\" to authorize, or by copying and pasting an authorization string in the notebook cell where indicated. \n","\n","---\n","\n","###**Alternative Location Requirements**\n","\n","Instead of the current Google Drive setup, this notebook can be run locally or in another hosted Jupyter environment with minor modifications to certain file location commands.  The folder structure must remain intact (same as the current folder structure).  \n","\n","---\n","\n","###**Library Dependencies**  \n","If using Google Colab, all required python libraries will be installed and loaded by the notebook, as necessary.    \n","If running locally, all required python libraries must be installed and avaialble on the system, or loaded by the notebook in a virtual environment.   \n","\n","Future updates to these libraries could result in compatability issues.  If library are encountered, it is possible to \"roll back\" the version of the required libraries to a previous version (check library documentation for details).  \n","\n","**extraction_utils**  \n","The custom file 'extraction_utils.py\" must exist in the \"*Code/*\" folder.  This file constains specialized functions for performing the report extraction tasks on predefined report types. Updates to this file may change what information is extracted from reports, or impact overall execution.  *Always create a backup of this file before modifying its contents*.\n","\n","\n","**Camelot**:   \n","PDF table extraction is handled by the \"camelot-py\" library.   \n","Current version 0.10.1  \n","https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/  \n","https://pypi.org/project/camelot-py/  \n","  \n","\n","**PyPDF2**:  \n","PDF text extraction is handled by the PyPDF2 library.  \n","Current version 1.26.0  \n","https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/  \n","https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2  \n","\n","**Additional packages installed:**\n","\n","Ghostscript >= 0.7  \n","pdftopng >= 3.4.2.17  \n","pdfminer.sit-20211012  \n","tabulate>=0.8.9  \n","pdftopng >= 0.2.3  \n","\n","---\n","###**PFAS Compounds**\n","\n","The \"PFAS_compounds.csv\" file contains the names, acronymns, and CAS Numbers for PFAS compounds to be extracted by this tool.  It must be located in the \"*Code/*\" folder.  Modifying the existing PFAS compound information in this file may have unintended consequences that affect the ability to extract data.  It may be possible to update this file to identify additional PFAS compounds to be extracted. *Always create a backup of this file before modifying its contents*.  \n","  \n","The PFAS Lab Report Extraction Tool cannot currently extract compound results other than PFAS.  Modifying this file will not allow other non-PFAS compounds to be extracted.  Doing so would require additional modifications to this notebook and the custom functions located in *extraction_utils.py*.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","###**Target Reports**  \n","Copy folder(s) containing the reports to be extracted into the \"*Target Reports/*\" folder.  The tool can process more than one folder at a time, if desired.  The name of the folder will be stored in the resulting output file, so it is recommended to name folders in a logical and consistent way.  \n","\n","Once target report folders have been extracted it is recommended to move them out of the \"*Target Reports/*\" folder (to avoid having them be extracted again when this code is run again).  Alternatively this code could potentially be modified to exclude previously extracted reports.) \n","\n","---\n","\n","###**Output Data:**  \n","Output data files will be saved in the \"*Output Data/*\" folder.  The following three files will be created, and each of their filenames will include the date and time that extraction was completed (EST).\n","\n","*  **\"Extracted PFAS Data - DATE TIME.csv\"**\n",">
